Splay Tree | Set 2 (Insert)
Following are different cases to insert a key k in splay tree.

1) Root is NULL: We simply allocate a new node and return it as root.
2) Splay the given key k. If k is already present, then it becomes the new root. If not present, then 
last accessed leaf node becomes the new root.

3) If new root’s key is same as k, don’t do anything as k is already present.

4) Else allocate memory for new node and compare root’s key with k.
…….4.a) If k is smaller than root’s key, make root as right child of new node, copy left child of root 
as left child of new node and make left child of root as NULL.
…….4.b) If k is greater than root’s key, make root as left child of new node, copy right child of root 
as right child of new node and make right child of root as NULL.

5) Return new node as new root of tree.

Example:

 
          100                  [20]                             25     
          /  \                   \                             /  \
        50   200                  50                          20   50 
       /          insert(25)     /  \        insert(25)           /  \  
      40          ======>      30   100      ========>           30  100    
     /          1. Splay(25)    \     \      2. insert 25         \    \
    30                          40    200                         40   200   
   /
